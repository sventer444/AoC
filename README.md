advent of code answers repository/website

runs with npm run start


Once again I have a tangled mess of code masqarading as an advent of code solution repository.
One day maybe I'll actually have a useable space to participate.
What I need to do is scrap most of this and then create some dashboard and probably have to self
host the server, and add pages to advent of code and eugeo or other web projects instead of
writing all these different bases.
I like the ascii art templates, hopefully those can be useable or saved
